	<exercise xml:id="exercises-sets-with-solution">
		<statement>
			Suppose that an object moving along an axis has instantaneous velocity <m>v(t) = 2t-3</m> and its position at time <m>t=1</m> is <m>s(1) = -1</m>.  What is the position of the object at <m>t = 5</m>?
		</statement>
		<hint> Don't forget that the velocity function is the derivative of position. </hint>
		<answer><m>s(5) = 11</m></answer>
		<solution>Since <m>v(t) = 2t-3</m>, it follows that <m>s(t) = t^2 - 3t + C</m>.  Moreover, because <m>s(1)=-1</m>, we see that <m>-1 = 1^2 - 3 \cdot 1 + C</m>, co <m>C = 1</m>.  Thus, <m>s(t) = t^2 - 3t + 1</m>, and <m>s(5) = 11</m>. </solution>
