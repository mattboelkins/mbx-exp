	<title>Using Knowls</title>

	<introduction>
		<p> In this section of the text, we will explore the use of <term>knowls</term>. </p>	
	</introduction>

	<subsection>
		<title>Things that are automatically knowl-ized</title>
		
		<p>Footnotes are even better as knowls.<fn>Because they appear adjacent to the footnote in the text when you click on them.</fn></p>

		<p>If we do a theorem that has a proof, the proof is automatically in a knowl.  The theorem structure in MBX also has several key levels/components:  theorem, title, index, statement, proof.</p>

		<theorem xml:id="theorem-MyTheorem">
			<title>My Theorem</title>
			<index>My Theorem</index>
			<statement><p>If a triangle has sides of length <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>, and <m>c</m>, and <m>a^2 + b^2 = c^2</m>, then the triangle is a right triangle.</p></statement>
			<proof><p>Here is my insightful argument.</p></proof>				
		</theorem>
		
		<p>Examples are also automatically put into knowls.</p>

		<example xml:id="example-ch-1-MyExample">
				<p> Here is an example application of Theorem <xref ref="theorem-MyTheorem" />.  Suppose that we have a triangle whose sides are of length 5, 12, 13.  Then, since <m>5^2 + 12^2 = 25 + 144 = 169 = 13^2</m>, it follows that the triangle must be a right triangle.</p>

		<title>How do exercises work?</title>

		<p>Exercises seem to be set up so that they appear as their own section.  Can we put them within a subsection?  Is this one of the things Rob is working on?</p>
