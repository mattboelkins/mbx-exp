				The position of a car driving along a straight road at time \(t\) in minutes is given by the function \(y = s(t)\) that is pictured in <a knowl="./knowl/act-car-graph.html" knowl-id="xref-act-car-graph" alt="Figure 1.3.3 " title="Figure 1.3.3 ">FigureÂ 1.3.3</a>. The car's position function has units measured in thousands of feet. Remember that you worked with this function and sketched graphs of \(y = v(t) = s'(t)\) and \(y = v'(t)\) in a previous activity . </p><span class="incontext"><a href="ch-1-activities.html#p-26">in-context</a></span>
